            <p> This project was the beginning of the term "flexbox" where I was taught to use flexbox to make a sidewise gallery of cat images. Below is a sample image of the webpage and also the html and css codes.</p>
            <p>Important code learned: <code>display: flex;</code> and codes for styling the flex</p>

            <p>This was the one of the beginning projects in the website so was a little basic. However finishing this project, I also made some tweaks on it by adding a checkbox and a radio input for the coffee and dessert sections.

            <p>This project was very helpful for making me understand the concept of colors. I found that there are 4 ways of representing a color in html: Basic Name, Hexa-decimal code, rgb composition and hsl composition. There is also a rgba or hsla code which manages the opacity of the added color. I also learned about linear gradient which is a really good feature. Below is a sample image of the webpage and also the html and css codes.</p>
            <p> Important code learned: <code>background: linear-gradient(color1,color2,color3(optional));</code></p>

            <p>In this project, I made a nutrition label including a required dietary intake for a person. I learned a lot about span and how span and flex work together with each other.

            <p>This project was just building a simple piano that taught how positioning relatively and absolutely works. I also learned about the @media command that rearranges the page accrding to its size and given conditions.
